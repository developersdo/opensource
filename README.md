</h1>

**Dominican Open Source** is an initiative to gather all possible public data about projects and their contributors related to the Dominican Republic in GitHub using the [GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/).

## Want to join?

There are different ways to participate in this local effort:

 - You can include your GitHub users by adding the term “Dominican” to your profile's location. (Note: Dominicana is also accepted)
 - You can improve the code of the [public website](src/client) or [the scraper](src/server).
 - And if you don't code you can check the grammar, the UX, the graphic design, [report bugs](https://github.com/developersdo/opensource/issues/new) - it is up to you ;)
 
## Development
 
If you want to run this project locally you will need: [NodeJS 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/). After git-cloning this project do:

**Note:** If you just want to develop the website then skip step 3 and 4.

 1. `npm install`
 2. Copy `config/default.json` to `config/development.json`.
 3. [Generate a GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).
 4. Add your GitHub personal access token to `config/development.json` (this file is [git-ignored](.gitignore)).
 5. `npm run serve` and open http://localhost:8080/opensource

That's it! Happy coding.
