<h1 align=center>✨ Local Open Source Communities ✨</h1>

This repository hosts the source code of the **http://developersdo.github.io/opensource** website.

**Local open source communities** is an initiative to gather all possible public data about projects from the Dominican Republic in GitHub using the [GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/). Build and serve a public website showing all the local efforts that Dominicans are contributing toward open source.

## Want to join?

There are different ways to participate in this local effort:

 - You can include your GitHub users by adding the term “dominican” to your profile's location. Note: Dominicana is also accepted.
 - You can improve the code of the website or the scraper.
 - And if you don't code you can check the grammar, the UX, the graphic design, [report bugs](https://github.com/developersdo/opensource/issues/new), it is up to you ;)
 
## Development
 
If you want to run this project locally you will need: [NodeJS 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/). After git-cloning this project do:

 1. `yarn install`
 2. Copy `config/default.json` to `config/development.json`.
 3. [Generate a GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).
 4. Add your GitHub personal access token to `config/development.json` (this file is git-ignored).

That's it! Happy coding.
